Group Project #3

https://totsapp.herokuapp.com/

This app targets children from ages 2-5, and is meant to help them get ready for preschool and kindergarden. It teaches them the basics about numbers, colors, shapes and sounds. It gathers data from the games played and displays it in graph form for the parents. This is meant to show the parents where the child can improve and where they are excelling.
